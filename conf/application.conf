# SAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILE

# Application's configuration file, must be named "application.conf" (HOCON format)
# ~~~~~
# You can include other configuration files in this main application.conf file:
#include "extra-config.conf"
#
# You can declare variables and substitute for them:
#mykey = ${some.value}
#
# And if an environment variable exists when there is no other subsitution, then
# HOCON will fall back to substituting environment variable:
#mykey = ${JAVA_HOME}

## Application name and version
app {
    version   = "2.0.r1"
    name      = "microservices-undertow-seed.s8"
    shortname = "MUS"
